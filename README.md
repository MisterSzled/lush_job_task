# STACK
 - React native
 - Expo
 - React native resuables
 - Tailwind / Nativewind
 - Redux
 - TanStack / React Query

# NOTES
 - Seperated main page flows from components

 - Single API entry point with "USE_MOCK" toggle static at the moment.

 - Redux for local state management.
 - Had to use product.name as the key in redux for demo purposes as the id's are all the same.
